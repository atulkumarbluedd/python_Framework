# we want to achieve command line execution to decide where our test will be executed i.e. in chrome or in firefox
#  py.test --browser_name firefox  --> run all test cases in firefox using cmd

# smarter way to create oject once and use it further, this can be done via returning page object whenever we are clicking
# and moving into the new page, this way we can optimize the code

# pending ********************
need to write a code when test is failed add screenshot

# read data using excel file
pip install openpyxl
